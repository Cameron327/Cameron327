Who I am: <br />
Self-driven and ambitious when it comes to completing my goals. Always ready to learn more about the world of coding/programming in any way possible. Dedicated and motivated to getting work done while also maintaining optimistic about life.

Where I am: <br />
Currently, I am a Sophomore at University of California, Davis majoring in Computer Science for a B.S. degree. Additionally, I am a Technical Lead for the Google Developer Student (DSC) Club where I lead workshops for aspiring coders/programmers like myself. I use skills I've learned from my programming courses as well as skills from attending Hackathons to create my own programming projects like my Discord Server Bot (which utilizes the Discord API) and my Sudoku Game/Solver (which utilizes my self-taught Python skills to produce its own GUI). From Hackathon, I was able to pick-up skills such as using UiPath's web-scraping tools to build my own apartment-finder algorithm.

Where I am going: <br />
I am super excited to continue my path as an aspiring Software Engineer. I've joined the Google DSC club to help teach others about the amazing world of programming. In addition, I've also joined a bootcamp where I build my own Slack App, where I utilize its own API and the Google Translate API.

Some things I do when I'm not studying or working: <br />
Playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on the Nintendo Switch competitively with my friends and family, watching Gordon Ramsay cooking videos on YouTube, binge-watching T.V. shows and movie franchises like Star Wars and The Flash.
