Who I am: <br />
Self-driven and ambitious when it comes to completing my goals. Always ready to learn more about the world of coding/programming in any way possible. Dedicated and motivated to getting work done while also maintaining an optimistic view about life.

Where I am: <br />
Currently, I'm a Junior at UC Davis majoring in Computer Science for a B.S. degree. Additionally, I'm a Full Stack Developer at Oneboard.live where I've created multiple different features for the platform. At school, I'm a Technical Lead for the Google Developer Student (DSC) Club where I lead workshops for aspiring coders/programmers like myself. Other than professional and school work, I like to build my skillset by attending Hackathons and completing personal projects. Right now, I've been keeping up my own personal website (https://cam-yee.netlify.app/) while also building a Weather App using React.js and Axios.js. I will continue to work as a Full Stack Developer at Oneboard while also trying to build my portfolio with more amazing personal projects.

Some things I do when I'm not studying or working: <br />
On my free time, I like to watch movies and T.V. shows that are connected to the MCU and DCEU superhero universes. In addition, I like playing Super Smash Bros. with my family.
